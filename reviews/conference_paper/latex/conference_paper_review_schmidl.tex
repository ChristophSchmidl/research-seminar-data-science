\section{Causal Inference in Time Series via Supervised Learning}

\subsection{Summary (not part of the review paper template)}

On the 14th June 2018 Taco Cohen who is a machine learning researcher at Qualcomm and is finishing his PhD in Machine Learning at the University of Amsterdam gave a presentation named "Equivariant Neural Networks" on the first Deep Learning Nijmegen Meetup.\\ 
Equivariant Neural Networks is the short term for Group equivariant Convolutional Neural Networks (G-CNNs) which are using G-convolutions (Group Convolutions) as their main building block and is based on his paper published in 2016 \cite{cohen2016group}. G-convolutions seem to be easy to use and do not introduce additonal computational overhead for discrete groups which are generated by translations, reflections and rotations of the samples. This newly introduced type of Group convolution layers makes it possible to exploit larger groups of symmetries and therefore makes the usage of some data augmentation techniques obsolete. Taco went through the technical details of equivariant neural networks and later on presented how his technique was used by other researchers in different domains.\\


\subsection{Topics to look up (not part of the review paper template)}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Granger causality
	\item Similar research to causal inference in time series
	\item Kernel Mean Embedding
	\item Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS)
	\item Maximum Mean discrepancy (MMD): See Paper "A kernel method for the two-sample problem"
	\item Traditional methods for identifying granger causality: Regression models such as vector autoregressive model (VAR) nad the Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
	\item Kernel Kalman Filter
	\item Conditional Embedding Operator (KKF-CEO)
\end{itemize}

	\item Is it a paper that is likely to have a lasting impact?
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Answer:}	
		\end{itemize}		
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Originality}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Reviewers should recognise and reward papers that propose genuinely new ideas. As a reviewer you should try to assess whether the ideas are truly new. Novel combinations, adaptations or extensions of existing ideas are also valuable.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Technical Quality}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Are the results technically sound?
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Answer:}	
		\end{itemize}			
	
	
	\item Are there obvious flaws in the conceptual approach?
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Answer:}	
		\end{itemize}		
	
	
	\item Are claims well-supported by theoretical analysis or experimental results?
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Answer:}	
		\end{itemize}		
	
	\item Are the experiments well thought out and convincing?
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Answer:}	
		\end{itemize}		
	
	
	\item Will it be possible for other researchers to replicate these results?
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Answer:}	
		\end{itemize}		
	
	
	\item Is the evaluation appropriate?
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Answer:}	
		\end{itemize}		
	
	
	\item Did the authors clearly assess both the strenghts and weaknesses of their approach?
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Answer:} The authors state that their approach also works with higher dimensional data but on reality it is restricted to three dimensional data. This is a bit misleading.
		\end{itemize}		
	
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Clarity and quality of writing}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Is the paper clearly written?
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Answer:}
